# Leap-Year-Checker
Design: CodeWithSMR

This is a simple application that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It is built using basic JavaScript and is a great tool for understanding how leap years are calculated.

## Features
- Input any year and check if it's a leap year
- Simple user interface for easy use
- Fast and accurate results based on the leap year rules

## How to Use
1. Enter a year into the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The result will display whether the year is a leap year or not.

## Leap Year Calculation
A year is considered a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4, but not by 100, **or**
- It is divisible by 400.

This logic is implemented in the JavaScript code.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for the functionality
